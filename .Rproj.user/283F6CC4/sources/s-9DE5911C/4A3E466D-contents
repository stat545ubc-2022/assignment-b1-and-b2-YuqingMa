# calmean

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
The calmean package takes input of the data table, the the property that user would like to group by, and the target column that we want to calculate its mean value, then return a column of calculated mean values.

## Installation

You can install the development environment of calmean by:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-YuqingMa/calmean")
```
Before get started, you need to install the following libraries. 

```{R, message = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("testthat")
library("tidyverse")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(calmean)

sample_trees = data.frame(
 genus_name = c("ACER","FRAXINUS", "HIBISCUS","PYRUS","STYRAX" ,"TILIA","ULMUS","ZELKOVA" ),
 diameter = c(14.468750,13.166667 , 4.500000 , 5.000000 , 5.333333, 11.875000,10.000000,10.000000)
 )
 cal_mean(sample_trees,"genus_name","diameter")
 # should return a column of mean diameters of different genus.
```
